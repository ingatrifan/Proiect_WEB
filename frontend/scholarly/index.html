      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        STOL is a web application that allows users to bypass the storage limits of regular drive services by allowing you to store files in the cloud while being connected
        on multiple drive accounts, without having to worry that uploading a certain file will exceed the limit of one of those particular accounts.
      </p>

    <section id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The application aims to abstract the usual file system operations available to anyone on their
        local environment. It does this by fragmenting the files and storing them using various
        online cloud-storage services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive.
        Also, support is provided for the easy reconstruction and download of the files stored using our application.
       <br>
        To be able to do this, our users need to authorize the application to make changes in a specific folder in their drive accounts.
        <br>
        This is all done by taking advantage of the Oauth 2.0 protocols, so the user doesn't actually need to give us access to any private information such as passwords etc.

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>

        used to create it.

        <h3>Frontend</h3>
        <p>
          On the frontend side multiple pages were implemented using vanilla(and valid) HTML5,
          CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <section id="Pages">
          <h3>Pages</h3>

            <li>Landing page
              <br>
              <p>
                This is the page the user sees when accessing the website
                for the first time. It briefly describes the application
                and guides the user towards the other pages.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Main Page
              <br>
              <p>
                This page is the primary part of the application, this is where the (logged in)
                user can access his saved files and interact with them.<br>
                The layout of the page is beginner-friendly so all users, no matter how experienced,
                can get by easily. Users can upload, view, download, and rename files. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Log-in and Register Pages
              <br>
              <p>
                The log-in and register pages contain forms that the user needs to fill in order to create or access an already existing account.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>About Us Page

              <li>Managing files(downloading,uploading and deleting) is made very easy by our beginner-friendly user interface. The upload button is easy to see and you
                can even use drag-and-drop to upload files, and as for deleting or renaming files, you can simply hover over a file and do that easily.
